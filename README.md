# INTRODUCTION

DataPipe is an application to connect and filter data from different and independent sources using intelligent data pipes.

# DISCLAIMER

This application was written during a hackaton (DAL) in 2011 and should not be used in production environments as it's now (there are some security issues that weren't addressed since there wasn't time to do so during the event).
